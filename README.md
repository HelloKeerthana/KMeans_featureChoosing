<h1>K-Means Clustering Analysis</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project uses K-Means clustering to identify patterns in a dataset with three distinct classes, resulting in three cluster blobs.</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>The code loops through different feature pairs, generating scatter plots to visualize how the data points are distributed. By analyzing these plots, the user can identify the feature pairs that produce the most blob-like (clustered) results.</p>
<h2>Clusters and Classes</h2>
<p>The clustering algorithm aims to group the data into three clusters (blobs), each representing a different class within the dataset. The output is a visualization of these three clusters, which allows for easy interpretation of the underlying data structure.</p>
